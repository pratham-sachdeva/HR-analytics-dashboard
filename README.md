## Dataset
For this case study, we adopt the Kimball modeling approach, including a Fact table storing yearly employee reviews and multiple dimension tables to provide contextual information. The data model adheres to a snowflake schema.
We initiate by loading and preparing our dataset in Power BI, ensuring data cleanliness and appropriate table naming conventions (Fact or Dim).

## How to use the Power BI Report
Download the Power BI report file HR Dashboard.pbix. Install Power BI Desktop, if you don't have it installed already. Open Power BI Desktop and open the downloaded file. Once the report is loaded, you can interact with the visuals, apply filters, and explore the customer churn analysis.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to DataCamp for providing the case study and dataset for this project. Their contribution made this analysis possible and helped me gain valuable insights into HR analytics.

I hope you find the insights valuable and applicable to your business scenarios. Happy analyzing!
